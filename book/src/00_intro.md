The ascii-invoicer is a command-line tool that manages projects and stores them not in a database but in a folder structure. New projects can be created from templates and are stored in a working directory. Projects can be archived, each year will have its own archive. A project consists of a folder containing a yaml file describing it and a number of attached files, such tex files. Projects can contain products and personal. You can create preliminary offers and invoices from your projects.
